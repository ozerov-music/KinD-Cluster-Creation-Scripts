# Learning-K8s-KinDly
A learning process of working with a local K8s cluster, provisioned through KinD.

## Goal
At my day job, I found myself working with both remote and local K8s clusters, and would like to expand my knowledge of how the different components of the system work and interact, as well as how to better manager the cluster, along with its security, services, jobs, pods, etc.

Since again, at work, containerization is a big part of our stack, I decided to use KinD for my learning process, as the multi-node architecture will make testing load balancing really interesting.
